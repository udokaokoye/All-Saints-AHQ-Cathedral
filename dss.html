     <span class="dss-topic">TEXT: LUKE 16:8</span>  <br>
      
      <p class="dss-text">("The rich man had to admire the dishonest rascal for being so shrewd. And it is true that the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with the world around them than are the children of the light.)
      
      A
      beautiful parable or call it a story, was said by Jesus and it was about a Manager who was dishonest in handling his employer's business. The Bible referred to this manager as a "Dishonest Manager". The man was going to lose his job as a manager and he did what made even the master call him "Shrewd" This word means intelligent, discerning and quick, etc. One of the many things we miss as children of God is the fact that we do not act shrewdly in the business of our lives and also even when we work as employees. We bring poverty to ourselves because we lack shrewdness. This manager in the passage knew his time was up and should he not act shrewdly, he will suffer lack and hunger and he would be a burden to himself, his family and the society. 
      
      Genuine source of income covers the nakedness of man. We earn and eat all, we get surprise money and squander it all on surprise liabilities....and in the end we blame other people. Children of God let us open our eyes, look and see and finally live. Because one of the biggest challenge of Christians is that we do not know how to create wealth, we are not able to sustain or keep it and to be able to do so we have to be shrewd. Be Shrewd!
      
      Are you using the resources that God has given you to build up treasure where no moth or rot can corrupt or you are busy destroying lives with them?
      
      Memorise: 1Timothy 6:10- “For the love of money is a root to all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greed and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.” 
       
      PRAYER: Lord open my eyes to intelligence of the world that I may deal shrewdly in the affairs of life.
       
      Insight: THE WORLD ALWAYS HAS A PLACE FOR THE SHREWD.</p>
